# ðŸ¤– AI/ML Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** from the ground up.

I'm currently exploring the core concepts of machine learning and applying them through real-world projects and guided courses.

The goal is to build a solid foundation in AI/ML and share my progress openly.

> Learning in public. One concept, one project at a time.

Stay tuned for updates, notebooks, and progress logs.
