Good evening, my friends.

We gather here tonight not as strangers, not as rivals, but as members of one human family, bound together by the simple belief that our best days are still ahead of us.

Now, I know the road has been hard. Too many families are working longer hours just to get by. Too many young people wonder if their dreams are slipping out of reach. And too often, we hear voices of fear and division that tell us we’re better off apart than together.

But here’s the truth: America — and the world — has never moved forward because of fear. We move forward because of hope. We move forward because of the determination of ordinary men and women who refuse to quit, who refuse to give in to cynicism, who still believe that if we work together, there is nothing we cannot achieve.

We stand today at a crossroads. One path is easy — the path of blame, of anger, of looking backwards. The other is harder — the path of responsibility, of compassion, of building bridges instead of walls. That path demands something of us. It asks us to listen. To respect one another. To remember that we rise or fall, not as individuals alone, but as one people.
