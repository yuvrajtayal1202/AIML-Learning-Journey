The Game of Gentlemen

Beneath the sun, on fields so wide,
Eleven hearts stand side by side.
A leather ball, a willow’s song,
A battle fierce, yet played lifelong.

The bowler storms with eyes of fire,
His spinning art, his speed, his guile.
The batsman waits, both calm and strong,
Dreams of centuries keep him long.

The crowd erupts with every cheer,
Their voices ringing, sharp and clear.
A six that soars into the sky,
A catch that stuns the watching eye.

From gully’s dive to keeper’s call,
The spirit of the game binds all.
Not just a sport, but life’s own art,
Cricket’s rhythm beats in every heart.
